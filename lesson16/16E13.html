        Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quit different. 
        Both are bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, 
        while oceans are what surrounded continents. Both have plants and 
        animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the 
        planet, whereas lakes support much smaller forms of life. When it is 
        time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy.
