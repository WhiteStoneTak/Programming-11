    <h1>
        World War I began in 1914 after the assasination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and 
        lasted until 1918. During the conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and 
        the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers) fought against Great Britain, France, 
        Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan, and the United States (the Allied Powers).
    </h1>
    <p>
        Thanks to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare, World War 
        I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By the time the war was 
        over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people - 
        soldiers and civilians alike - were dead.
