        Thanksgiving is one of America's most treasured holidays and traditions. 
        While there are some constants in the way we observe the day, it can 
        mean different things to different people. The American Thanksgiving 
        holiday began as a feast in the early days of the American colonies 
        almost 400 years ago. In 1620, a boat filled with more than 100 people 
        sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from England to settle in the New World. 
        This religious group had begun to question the beliefs of the Church of 
        England and they wanted to separate from it.
