    <h2>Apollo 11 Space Mission</h2>
    <p>
        On <span>July 16, 1969</span>, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched 
        from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its mission 
        was to go where no human being had gone before-the 
        moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael 
        Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on 
        the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood 
        plain, on <span>July 20, 1969</span>. The moonwalk took place the 
        following day. On <span>July 21, 1969</span>, at precisely <span>10:56 
        EDT</span>, Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar 
        Module and took his famous first step onto the moon's 
        surface. He declared, <q>That's one small step for 
        man, one giant leap for mankind.</q> It was a 
        monumental moment in human history!
