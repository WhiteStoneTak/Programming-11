        <span class="p">Earth</span> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, <span class="p">Earth</span> formed over 4.5 billion years ago. <span class="p">Earth's</span> gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which
        is <span class="p">Earth's</span> only natural satellite. <span class="p">Earth</span> orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an <span class="p">Earth</span> sidereal year. During this time, <span class="p">Earth</span> rotates about its axis about 366.256 times.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="p">Earth's</span> axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on <span class="p">Earth</span>. The gravitational interaction between <span class="p">Earth</span> and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes <span class="p">Earth's</span> orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. <span class="p">Earth</span> is the densest planet in the Solar System
        and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.
