    <h1>MY CHILDHOOD DAYS</h1>
    <p>
        The sweet memories of this period are glorious. They have the 
        freshness of a dream. A child has no responsibilities; He is 
        looked after by his parents. He gets everything without doing 
        anything. A child enjoys perfect freedom. He has no worries, 
        no hardships and no troubles. He can say anything to anybody. 
        If a child does something wrong, he is generally excused. 
        Even his meaningless chatter is a source of joy. A child's 
        life is full of innocence. He builds castles of sand and 
        feels very happy. He gets joy in floating paper boats. He 
        often quarrels with others over small things but soon forgets 
        about it, Childhood is really the golden period of one's life.
