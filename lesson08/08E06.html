            I like the beetles!! For a variety of reasons, but the short answer is that they had two superbly 
            talented lead singers rather than just one, but much more importantly, both became extraordinarily 
            talented songwriters. John Lennon and Paul McCartney may or may not have become successful on 
            their own.
