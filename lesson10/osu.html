        Osu! (stylized as osu!) is a rhythm game primarlly developed, published and created by Dean "peppy" Herbert. 
        Originally released for Microsoft Windows on September 16, 2007, the game has also been ported to macOS. 
        Its gameplay is based on titles including Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, Taiko no Tatsujin, Beatmania, IIDX, Ellite 
        Beat Agents, O2Jam, StepMania, and DJMax. The game has an active e-sports community, and is also sometimes 
        recommended by professional players of other games to practice or warm-up.
