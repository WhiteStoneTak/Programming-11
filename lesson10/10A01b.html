            In every bit of honest writing in the world, there is a base theme. Try
            to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. 
            <q>KNOWING A MAN WILL NEVER LEAD TO HATE</q> and early always lead to love.
            There are shorter means, many of them. There is writing promoting social change, 
            writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always the base theme. 
            <q>TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER!</q>
