        The game includes several songs with up to five levels of difficulty. The player uses VR motion controllers 
        to wield a pair of lightsabers, the left one colored red and the right one colored blue by default. In each 
        song, the game presents the player with a stream of approaching blocks, laid out in sync with the song's 
        beats and notes, located in one of the 12 possible positions of a 4x3 grid.
        <p>
        The game also features the option of playing some songs in 360°, or 90° orientations where blocks approach 
        from around the player. Each block varies in color, corresponding to the color of the saber that should be 
        used to slash it. It may also be marked with an arrow indicating one of eight possible directions in which 
        the block may be required to be slashed through. There are also blocks with dots instead of arrows, which 
        players may hit in any direction.

        When a block is properly slashed by a saber, it is destroyed and a score is awarded, based on the length and 
        angles of the swing and the accuracy of the cut. In addition, there are occasionally mines that the player 
        should not hit, and obstacles in the form of oncoming walls that the player's head should avoid. There is 
        also a white bar underneath the path where the blocks travel, which slowly fills up as the player hits notes 
        correctly.
        <p>
        If the player hits any note in the incorrect direction, the white health bar' will become less full by a 
        small chunk. If the player completely misses a note, the bar will lose a large chunk. If the bar becomes 
        completely empty, the game will end.
