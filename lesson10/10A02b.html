        Here is a quote from the book of Mice and Men:
        <p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.googlereads.com">
            <q>
                In every bit of honest writing in the world, 
                there is a base theme. Try to understand men, 
                if you understand each other you will be kind 
                to each other. <q>KNOWING A MAN WELL NEVER LEADS 
                TO HATE</q> and nearly always leads to love. 
                There are shorter means, many of them. There is 
                writing promoting social change, writing punishing 
                injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but 
                always that base theme. <q>TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH 
                OTHER! </q>
            </q>
