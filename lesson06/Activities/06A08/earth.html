            The <font color="lightblue">Earth</font> is our planet. It's the third rock from the sun, 
            and it's covered in liquid water. It contains a molten 
            core that swirls and churns, creating the magnetic field 
            that makes our compasses work. Clouds float high in the 
            atmosphere and rain down refreshing drops of water on the 
            <font color="lightblue">Earth</font>â€™s life forms.
