            <b>Mercury</b> is the closest planet to the sun. It was 
            named after the Roman messenger because it goes 
            around the sun really fast. It is desolate and 
            empty, like the Earthâ€™s moon. During the day, it 
            boils, and during the day, it's freezing. <b>Mercury</b> 
            is the second smallest planet in the Solar System.
