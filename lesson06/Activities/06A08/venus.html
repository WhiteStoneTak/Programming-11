            <i>Venus</i> is a beautiful, cloudy planet. It’s the 
            second closest planet to the sun and is just 
            slightly smaller than the Earth. It rains 
            sulphuric acid and volcanoes explode 
            continuously. It’s always boiling hot on 
            <i>Venus</i> because the clouds hold heat in like an 
            oven. The atmospheric pressure is so tremendous 
            that all spacecraft that have landed on <i>Venus</i> 
            have been crushed within hours.
