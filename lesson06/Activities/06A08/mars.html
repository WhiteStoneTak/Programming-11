            Mars is known as the “Red Planet”. The Romans 
            thought that it was the land of wars and bloodshed, 
            so they named it after the Roman god of war. 
            Percival Lowell spotted canals on Mars and thought 
            that Martians lived there. However, the Viking 
            spacecraft landed on Mars and found that there was 
            no life, and no blood, just rusty rocks.
