        <font color="fuchsia">Jupiter</font> is named after the leader of the Roman gods, 
        and it is quite fitting since <font color="fuchsia">Jupiter</font> has more mass 
        than the rest of the planets combined. It's so 
        humongous that it could have become a star like the 
        sun if it was just a bit bigger. It has such a 
        strong gravitational pull that it has a 
        solar-system-like collection of moons orbiting 
        around it.
