            After the disappointment that is Fates, I really hoped that 
            FE can find its ground again with a strong title. And did 
            they deliver a great game. Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a 
            tactical role-playing game with life-sim element and heavy 
            emphasis on strategy where you play as a professor in a 
            royal institute. The graphics look great most of the game 
            however i find that the architecture in the game can be 
            either hit or miss. The best way to describe this game is 
            "if Persona 5 was a Fire Emblem" as there a many thing you 
            can do outside like interacting with townsfolk. The combat 
            is as great as expected although I thought the teaching 
            mechanics is a bit wonky and tacky. Overall a great game 
            despite some major flaws, plus a huge point for high replay 
            ability. 9/10 for me!!!!
