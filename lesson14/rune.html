            Rune Factory 4 Special is an interesting case as I didn't think 
            I would enjoy this game as much i did. The game is essentially 
            life sim + farm sim + dating sim. It's a very versatile game 
            that includes every single bit that makes series like Animal 
            Crossing or Harvest Moon great. The combat is surprisingly 
            entertaining and the cast is all-around lovely people. The only 
            problem is that you can tell this game was not made recently 
            but rather ported. Rf4 was originally a 3DS title and hence, it 
            is understandable if you find the art style a little old or 
            jarring looking. Also, the voice acting is great but rather 
            sparse and limited. In celebration that Rune Factory 5 is 
            coming, I thought I would try out 4 and wasn't disappointed. 
            8/10 for me!!
