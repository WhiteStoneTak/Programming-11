            This a series I did not want to pick up due to how "sugary" it looks. 
            And I was kind of right: this series is full of light-hearted fluff. 
            Don't come to this series expecting action packed games. This bundle 
            came with 3 games from the 3DS: Rorona, Totori, Meruru. Atelier 
            mainly focus on crafting, gathering and has some combat segments. 
            It's kind of like Rune Factory 4 but instead of farm-sim, it's 
            crafting. The art really showed its age. As expected, the company did 
            not polish the art too much before porting it. The story is for 
            casual and relaxing but can be borderline esoterically happy. The 
            combat in the game is very simple and should not trouble you too 
            much. The biggest flaw of the bundle is how much potential the 
            plotline could have gone for the better yet it did not. Ranking game 
            wise: Rorona > Meruru > Totori. 6/10 for me!!!!
