        The 

        introduction of the <span class="b">pineapple</span> cultivation to Europe in the 17C made it a signigicant 

        cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s <span class="b">pineapple</span> has been commercially grown in 

        greenhouses and many tropical plantations and it is the third most important tropical 

        fruit in world production.
