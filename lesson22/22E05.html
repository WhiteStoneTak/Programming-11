        The ceetah is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae that occures in North, Southern and East Africa, and a few localities in Iran. it inhabits a 
        variety of mostly arid habitats like dry forests, scurb forests, and savannahs. The species is IUCN Red Listed as Vulnerable, as it suffered a 
        substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to habitat loss, poaching for the illegal pet trade, and conflict with humans. By 
        2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken 
        steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.
