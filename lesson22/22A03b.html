        In this example, the image is taller than the element containing it, 
    </p>
    <div>
        <h2>Without Clearfix</h2>
        <img src="image/pineapple.jpg" alt="pineapple" class="img1" width="170" height="170">
        The pineapple is  a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called a pineapple, and the 
        most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.
    </div>
    <p style="clear: right;">
        Add a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the containing element, to fix this problem:
    </p>
    <div class="clearfix">
        <h2>With Clearfix</h2>
        <img src="image/pineapple.jpg" alt="pineapple" width="170" height="170" class="img2">
        In the 20C, Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, 
        especially for the US, but in 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines, accounted for 
        nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
