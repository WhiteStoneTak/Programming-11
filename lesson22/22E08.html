            Although recent cooler conditions have brought some respite, the states of New South Wales and Victoria are once again 
            braced for the return of severe fire danger - with high temperatures and gusty winds forecast over the next few days. 
            Some 27 people have so far been killed - including four firefighters - and an estimated 10 million hectares (100, 000 sq 
            km or 15.million acres)  of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned.

            The have benn fires in every Australian state, but New South Wales has been hardest hit, Blazes have torn through 
            bushland, wooded areas, and national parks like the Blue Mountains. Some of Australia's largest cities have also 
            been affected, including Melbourne and Sydney -- where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick 
            plumes of smoke have blanketed urban center. Earlier in December, the smoke was so bac in Sydney that air 
            quality measeured 11 times the <q>hazardous</q> level.
