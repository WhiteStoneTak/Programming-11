        The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called a pineapple, and the 
        most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliacease. The pineapple is 
        indigenous to South America where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The 
        introduction of the pineapple cultivation to Europe in the 17C made it a signigicant 
        cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s pineapple has been commercially grown in 
        greenhouses and many tropical plantations and it is the third most important tropical 
        fruit in world production. In 20C, Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, 
        especially for the US, but in 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for 
        nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
