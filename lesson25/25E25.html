            <h2>All about arts</h2>
            <p>
                The NWSS Drama department provides students with exciting opportunities to develop and 
                explore the dramatic arts. Students study improvisation, stage movement, vocal 
                technique, character development, script writing and production. Every second year a 
                major musical is cast and produced by staff and students at NWSS and performed in the 
                historic MASSEY THEATRE. Stage plays are produced in off musical years and range from 
                dramatic to comedic. Senior Drama students take part in NWSS' anti-bullying campaign 
                called "ROCKSOLID". Since 2004 NWSS drama has partnered with the NWPD to help end bullying. 
                Drama and creative writing students write and perform plays to help bring change and to 
                create bully-free communities. New in 2016, NWSS drama students also have opportunities to 
                travel to NYC and other future locations to see plays.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Prior to the 1860s the site of the present school was a public cemetery where many of the prominent 
                citizens of New Westminster were interred. After development in the 1870s the remains of those buried 
                were transferred to the Fraser Cemetery, located elsewhere in the city. During the Second World War 
                the corner of 10th Avenue and 8th, where the present school is located, was leased to the Federal 
                Government. The site served as a soldiers' barracks, used for training and housing the Royal 
                Westminster Regiment. After World War Il, the barracks were moved to the University of British Columbia 
                and the rest of the cemetery was demolished. Finally, in 1948 The public works yard was moved and the 
                site was transferred to the New Westminster School Board for the construction of offices and a new high school.
