        <div align="center">Billy's Bob's recipe for Garlic Toast</div>
        <p>
        My recipe for delicious garlic toast requires some ingredients. Here's what you need to make garlic toast.
        <p>
        <ul>list of Needed Items
            <li>Garlic Powder or Crushed Garlic
            <li>Some Slices of Bread
            <li>Toaster
            <li>Butter Knife
            <li>Butter or Margarine
        </ul>
        <p>
        The first thing you need to do is take the bread and spread a 
        little bit of margarine or butter on it using the butter knife. 
        The take the crushed or powdered garlic and sprinkle it 
        generously on the bread. The pop it in the toaster and press 
        the toast button. Be careful not to burn yourself! When it's 
        done, use tongs to grab the hot toast and put in on a plate. 
        Then it's ready to serve!
