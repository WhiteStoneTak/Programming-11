    <h1>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h1>
    <p>Tale as old as time</p>
    <p>True as it can be</p>
    <p>Barely even friends</p>
    <p>Then somebody bends</p>
    <p>Unexpectedly</p>
    <p>Just a little change</p>
    <p>Small to say the least </p>
    <p>Both a little scared</p>
    <p>Neither one prepared </p>
    <p>Beauty and the Beast</p>
    <p>Ever just the same</p>
    <p>Ever a surprise</p>
    <p>Ever as before</p>
    <p>And ever just as sure</p>
    <p>As the sun will rise</p>
    <p>Ever just the same</p>
    <p>And ever a surprise, yeah</p>
    <p>Eber as before</p>
    <p>And ever just as sure</p>
    <p>As the sun will rise</p>
    <p>Tale as old as time</p>
    <p>Tune as old as song</p>
    <p>Bitterswet and strange</p>
    <p>Finding you can change</p>
    <p>Learning you were wrong</p>
    <p>Certain as the sun</p>
    <p>(Certain as the sun)</p>
    <p>Rising in the east</p>
    <p>Tale as old as time</p>
    <p>Song as old as rhyme</p>
    <p>Beauty and the Beast</p>
    <p>Tale as old as time</p>
    <p>Song as old as rhyme</p>
    <p>Beauty and the Beast</p>
    <p>Beauty and...</p>
    <p>Beauty and the Beast</p>
