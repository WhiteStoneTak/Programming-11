    <h1>THE SHARK</h1>
    <p>Sharks are a group of clasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and an the sister group to the rays. However, the term "shark" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans.</p>
