    <h1 style="background-color: dodgerblue;">Piranhas</h1>
    <p style="background-color: tomato;">
        Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, 
        for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; 
        they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas 
        first instinct is to flee, not attack. This fear of humans make sense. 
        Far more piranhas are eaten by people the people are eaten by piranhas. 
        If the fish are well-fed, they won't bite humans.
