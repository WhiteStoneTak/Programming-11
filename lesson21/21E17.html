            A version for Android devices was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website 
            interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app on June 15, 2014 and an app for Windows 10 tablets and 
            computers in October 2016.

            The app allows users to upload photos and videos, which can be edited with filters and organized with 
            tags and location information. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can like 
            photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed.
