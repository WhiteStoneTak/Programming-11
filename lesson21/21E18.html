        The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small 
        demesticated carnivorous mammal that valued by humans for its companionship and ability to hunt vermin and 
        household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years, and are currently the most popular 
        pet in the world. Owing to their close association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere on Earth.
