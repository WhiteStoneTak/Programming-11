    <div class="title">Shoul all hospitals use electronic health records?</div>
    <p>
        Electronic health records should used because they are permanent. Unlike paper 
        records, electronic health records do not wear or break down over rime. They are 
        stored on computer bard drives and servers, so their data remains intact despite the 
        years that pass or what happens to the provider. Smith mentions that over time, 
        many hospitals or organizitions that use paper records lose track of them or find that 
        they are destroyed due to fire or flooding. Electronic health records, on the other 
        hand, are disaster proof and will last as long as they serves that store the, are 
        operational. Because of this permanence, they should be used hospitals instead of 
        paper records.
