            Math seems difficult because it takes time and 
            energy. many people don't experience 
            sufficient time to <q>get</q> math lessons, and they 
            fall behind as the teacher moves on. Many 
            move on to study more complex concepts with 
            a shaky foundation. We often end up with a 
            weak structure that is doomed to collapse at 
            some point.
