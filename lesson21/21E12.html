        Mount Seymour is a mountain located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, 
        Canada. It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising to the north fron the shores of Burrad Inlet and Indian Arm to a summit 
        of 1,449m (4,754ft) above the Indian River and Deep Cove neghbourhood. Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its 
        ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area. It is named in honour of Frederick Seymour, second governor of the 
        Colony of British Columbia. The name is used to refer to the ridge although the main summit is one of several, and is also known 
        as Third Peak.
