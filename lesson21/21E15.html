        The death toll is estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to

        cruel war in the annuals of the human race; a year which marked, the 
        end at least for a time, of man's destruction of man; unfortunately a 
        year in which developed a most fatal infectious disease causing the 
        death of hundreds of thousands of human beings. Medical science for
