        Ancient Egypt, or the Kingdom of Kemet, was a society that began about 3150 BC,[1] and 
        lasted until 20 BC when it was invaded by the Roman Enpire.
    </p>
    <p class="second_paragraph">
        Egypt grew along the River Nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium 
        BC. Its land went from the Nile delta to Nubia, a kingdom which today is mostly in the Sudan.
    </p>
    <p class="third_paragraph">
        For most of its history, Egypt was prosperous since the water from the Nile made sure that 
        the Egyptians would have good crops. Crops were grown after the Nile flood water went down. 
    </p>
    <p class="fourth_paragraph">
        The Egyptians created a way of writing using hieroglyphs, built hoge temples and tombs, 
        traded with other areas, and had a powerful army. Their religion had many gods, and its priests 
        were powerful and rich. Their rulers, called Pharaohs, were thought to be close to the gods.
