    <h1>Gravity</h1>
    <p>
        <span>Gravity</span> is the force that attracts two bodies toward each other. the force that causes apples to fall toward the ground and the planets to orbit the sun. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Gravity</span> is one of the four fundamental forces, along with the electromagnetic, strong and weak forces. It is what causes objects to have weight. When you weigh yourself, the scale tells you how much <span>gravity</span> is acting on your body. The formula for determining weight is: weight equals mass times <span>gravity</span>. On Earth, <span>gravity</span> is a constant 9.8 meters per second squared, or 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, philosophers such as Aristotle thought that heavier objects accelerate toward the ground faster. But later experiments showed that wasn't the case. The reason that a father will fall more slowly than a bowling ball is because of the drag from air resistance, which acts in the opposite direction as the acceleration due to <span>gravity</span>.
