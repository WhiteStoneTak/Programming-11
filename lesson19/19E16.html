    <h1>DAISIES</h1>
    <p class="first_paragraph">
        Daisies symbolize innocence and purity. This stems an old Celtic legend. In 
        Norse mythology, the daisy is Freya's scred flower. Freya is the goddess of 
        love, beauty, and fertility, and as such the daisy came by symbolize childbirth. 
        motherhood, and new beginnings.
    </p>
    <p class="second_paragraph">
        Daisy flowers represent innocence and they are usually linked to children or new borns. These flowers were 
        often used in flower arrangements as gifts for children and their parents. This flower symbolizes innocence 
        because it is also a symbol of new beginning and we all know that children are our hope for a better day and are 
        new beginnings and hope for the future.
