        <p>In my youger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that 
            I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like 
            criticizing anyone, ' hetold me, 'just remember that all the people in this 
            world haven't had the advantages that you've had. '
