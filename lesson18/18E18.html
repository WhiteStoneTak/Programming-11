        <h3>AURORA BOREALIS</h3>
        <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are acttally collisions between 
            electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphare. 
            The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and sourthern 
            hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora 
            australis' in the south. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale 
            green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and 
            violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or 
            scattered clouds of lights to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or shooting rays 
            that light up the sky with an eerie glow.
